# Smog-related pollution prediction in Warsaw, Poland

I propose a possible approach to solving the smog-related pollution prediction problem using the relationships between the weather and pollution data. I researched the solutions that have been published up to this point, gathered the data and went through the process of data mining in order to extract the knowledge. The statistical model have been created that explains the relationships in the data.

The project consists of following subproblems:
1. Historic weather and pollution data gathering (different measurement point in the city).
2. Data wrangling and transformation
3. Exploratory data analysis and finding the relation between features
4. Building the tree-based predictive model for the future pollution
5. Model testing and results interpretation

The best model obtains R2 of 0.72. The results could be improved by obtaining weather/pollution data measured in exactly the same point in the city.
